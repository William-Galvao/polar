# Ushuaia

First project developed by Andrey Gustavo with remote assistance from William Galv√£o.

## About

The intention was to practice Git/Github commands, componentization with Vue, routing with Vue Router and styling with Tailwind.

The chosen theme is a paradise that we will still visit in the future. <3
